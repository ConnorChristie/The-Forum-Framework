The Forum Framework (TFFW) is a php framework aimed towards internet forums and bulletin boards. 
Like the popular forum content management systems (CMS), such as phpbb and mybb, TFFW lets you make your very own forum. 
Unlike these CMSs TFFW is not a cms. Instead it is a php framework that allows you to program a brand new forum CMS quickly and easily. 
This allows you to create your forum exactly the way you want. 
If you can't, or don't want to create a new forum CMS from scratch, you can use one of our great templates. 
This provides a more familiar, user friendly CMS. 
TFFW is not limited towards just forums. You can easily modify it to create other CMS programs, such as a blog or something more ambitious

USING TFFW AS IT IS NOW IS EXTREMELY UNRECOMMENDED. THE CODE IS MOST LIKELY TO CHANGE DRAMATICALLY AS I DEVELOP IT
